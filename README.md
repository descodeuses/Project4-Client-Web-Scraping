### Project 4 >  Web Scraping & API - Client Repository

This project is a one page application using the [Node-Express-Server](https://github.com/descodeuses/Node-Express-Server) as backend to get items, posts and laptops data from different sources (fake data from local json file, data from jsonplaceholder api, and data from web scraping).

Items data have complete CRUD operations, posts and laptops data have only read all operation with some filter's features.

All interections with dom elements are done with [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) like displaying data and listenning events.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) is used as frontend css framework.

To get started, you need to clone the [Node-Express-Server](https://github.com/descodeuses/Node-Express-Server), then follow the instructions in README.md.
Once the server is running, you can run the client in your browser.
